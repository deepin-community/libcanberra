Description: simple abstract interface for playing event sounds
 libcanberra defines a simple abstract interface for playing event
 sounds.

 libcanberra relies on the XDG sound naming specification for
 identifying event sounds. On Unix/Linux the right sound to play
 is found via the mechanisms defined in the XDG sound theming
 specification.
